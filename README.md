# Object Detection Security System

## Overview

This project implements a security system using OpenCV, machine learning, and a touch of deep learning for object detection. The system is designed to identify and track objects in real-time using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- **Object Detection:** Utilizes the power of OpenCV and deep learning to detect and classify objects in a given environment.
- **Real-time Tracking:** Provides real-time tracking of detected objects, ensuring continuous monitoring.
- **Security Integration:** Customized to serve as a security system, alerting and responding to potential security threats.
- **Scalability:** The system is easily scalable and adaptable to different security requirements.

## Dependencies

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (>=3.6)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (>=4.0)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
